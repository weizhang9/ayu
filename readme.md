This is a command line tool version of random password generator. I used this project to learn Rust so there are a lot improvements can be done, until then I will keep it in this repo instead of publishing for public usage. Please feel free to clone it to build a binary locally to run in your command line if you think this would be useful.

## How to use
1. clone this repo
2. in the root of this repo, run `cargo build --release`
3. now you will see a `target` directory generated
4. under `./target/release` you can see the binary `ayu` which is this tool
5. put the binary at your desired location and add the `path/to/ayu` to your $PATH in .bahrc (sorry it only supports MacOS at the moment)
6. run `ayu --help` in your command line to see options of the tool

### Basic usage
- you can run `ayu -L=20 -C=1`  

This command generates you a random password of a length of 20 and it contains alphameric + special charset, which is the default charset. You could leave the `-C` flag if you want the default charset, otherwise there are 4 options to choose from. You can run `./ayu --help` to see all the options.
